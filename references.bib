	abstract = {The evaluation of numerous school reforms requires an understanding of the value of better schools. Given the difficulty of calculating the relationship between school quality and student outcomes, I turn to another method and use house prices to infer the value parents place on school quality. I look within school districts at houses located on attendance district boundaries; houses then differ only by the elementary school the child attends. I thereby effectively remove the variation in neighborhoods, taxes, and school spending. I find that parents are willing to pay 2.5 percent more for a 5 percent increase in test scores. This finding is robust to a number of sensitivity checks.},

	abstract = {In this Chapter, we critically review the sizable literature that values school quality and performance through housing valuations. While highly variable in terms of research quality, the literature consistently finds housing valuations to be significantly higher in places where measured school quality is higher. Thus parents are prepared to pay substantial amounts of money to get their children educated in better performing schools. This conclusion emerges from studies across many countries, using a variety of identification strategies, and at different levels of the education system.},

@article{hs2025,
	abstract = {In this paper, we study the house price effects of local school choice opportunities among public primary schools using a rare and large-scale reform that abolished binding catchment areas in North Rhine-Westphalia, the largest German state with 18 million inhabitants. To estimate the reform's effect on valuations of houses, we compare houses with different local school choice sets, before and after the reform. We find that gaining access to a school within 2,000 meters and with a higher transition rate to the academic track (relative to the initial neighborhood school) increases house prices by 1.5 percent. This effect is larger when the more attractive school is closer and diminishes as distance grows. The full reform effect materializes roughly five years after reform onset.},
