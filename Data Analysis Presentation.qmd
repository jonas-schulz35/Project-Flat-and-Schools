# Introduction 

## Motivation 

- Decreasing rate of owner occupied Flats in Germany & NRW @sv2025

- Measuring the difference in owner occupied flats and rented flats like @k2016 
  for energy efficiency

- Emphasizing the value of school choice related to living in flats
  
- Comparison to the choice of schooling for houses like @hs2025

---

# Introduction

## Research Question 

- Has distance to school an impact on prices per squaremeter for flats as it has
  for houses?

# Data

## Data for Primary Schools and Flats 

- Data from the RWI Data @s2024 including variable explanation and description

- Apartments in NRW that are owner occupied and rented 

- Schooling Data for NRW with School Social Index and Distance to School by the 
  Ministry for Schools in NRW

# Data 

## Descriptive Statistics

\begin{table}

\end{table}

# Methodology 

## Empirical Strategy 

**OLS Regresssion** 

- Measuring the difference for rented and for bought apartments 

- Using of a Hedonic Price Index like @b1999 @bm2011
  for characteristica for flats

- Treatment group for the radius of one kilometer for the closest school 

- Estimating semi logs for owner occupied and rented flats per squaremeter @k2016

# Methodology

## Regression 

 
$$Pricesqm_{log} = beta_{Treat} + X_{Fur} + SSI_{Factor}$$
  -$beta_{Treat}$: Equals 1 for treatment group  
  -$X_{Fur}$: Vector for Dummy Variables for Furnishing of Apartments
  -$SSI_{fak}$: Factor variable for Social School index

## OLS Regression table

# Results

## Boxplots for distance to school for bought apartments

## Boxplots for distance to school for rented apartments

# Conclusion 

## Key Takeaways 

- Treatment effect has an impact on prices for rented and bought flats
- Higher impact for bought apartments  
- School Social Index is positive correlated with the distance to school by the
  average treatment effect 

---

# Conclusion

## Limitations of our approach 

- Omitted variable bias and measurement problems for some spezific variables 

- Limitations due to missing data 

- Multicollinearity between flat characteristics
